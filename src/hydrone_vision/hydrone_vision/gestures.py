"""
gestures — pure core of the Phase 3 gesture reader: keypoints -> gesture.

No camera, no ROS, no model: tested headless in test/test_gestures.py. The
pose backends in gesture_detector_node turn an image into COCO-17 keypoints in
PIXELS; everything here works on those.

Image convention: x to the right, y down. Keypoints are COCO-17.

Vocabulary (straight arms; angle measured from the hanging arm):
  both down ...................... HOVER      (neutral: hold position)
  one horizontal ................. DIREITA / ESQUERDA (drone goes to the side
                                   the arm points to, AS SEEN IN THE IMAGE)
  both horizontal (T) ............ STOP       (hold position, explicit)
  both up (Y) .................... SUBIR      (on the ground, held => take off)
  both diagonal down (A) ......... DESCER
  one up, the other down ......... AFASTAR    (drone backs away from the operator)
  one diagonal up, other down .... APROXIMAR  (drone moves toward the operator)
  one up + the other horizontal .. POUSAR     (land)
Anything outside the bins (bent arm, dead zone, unsure keypoint) is NENHUM,
which the mission treats as HOVER.

"As seen in the image" is also as seen by the drone: the camera looks along
the drone's nose, so image right is the drone's right. Facing the drone, the
operator's LEFT arm is on image right, so the drone moves where the arm points.
